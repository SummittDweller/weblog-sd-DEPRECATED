I heard this somewhere, but can't find a documented source, so I guess I am quoting myself now?  :grinning:
```
"When facing a challenge, look past it, but don't overlook it."
                                    - Mark A. McFate
```
Note to self: It may be time for another web site... of favorite quotes.
