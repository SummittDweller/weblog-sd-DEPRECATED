I drove the 5 of us, plus luggage, in our mini-van to Minneapolis for our departure, and we left home early just in case there were surprises.  Good thing we did!  I drove US 20 to I35 with a stop in Storm Lake for a late lunch.  Not long after that stop we hit the first snag and found I35 closed, in both directions, just south of the Iowa-Minnesota border.  The stop and detour there set us back about a half hour or so...no problem.

We booked and found off-site parking near the airport in Minneapolis, and got dropped off at the correct terminal for _Iceland Air_, which will forever be known in this household as "Iceland Error".
