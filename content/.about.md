My real name is Mark McFate, `Summitt Dweller` was originally my _Geocaching.com_ player name, and it still is, but I've applied it to a number of other pursuits over the years.  So, welcome to my personal blog.  FYI: I also have a "professional" blog at https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM for all things related to my "real" work at Grinnell College, where I've been the 'Digital Library Applications Developer' since September 2012.
